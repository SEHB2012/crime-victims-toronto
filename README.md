# Overview

Using data from OpenData Toronto and the Annual Toronto Police Victims of Safety report, this paper analyses female victimization rates across different age groups and types of crimes. The subsequent analysis establishes that assault victimization rates have never been higher and that females from ages 25 to 34 are most susceptible to crime. This gender-specific research offers policymakers valuable insights to craft targeted policies, aiming to mitigate the specific risks faced by females in the city and reduce Gender Violence overall.
